# Mostly Functional Programming - Study Group

## Recommended development environment

Plugins can be installed directly from the IDE

* Visual Studio Code
* Ionide-fsharp plugin
* Fantomas formatter
  * This formatter is used by default from Ionide when you _right-click_ / _Format Document_ from within some F# code
  * If the formatter is not found you will be prompted to install it (I use the global option)

## These files represent topics we discussed implementated in `F#`

* exercises.fsx - Building `zip` and `zipWith`
* list.fsx - Writing our own version of a Linked List

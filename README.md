# Mostly Functional Programming - Study Group

## Overview

Our MS Teams location is [Mostly Functional Programming](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a79m5hLXyAMQRj89F5b1hqNO_XYTOqigsz6I_P_hIdFw1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=eb4f5e64-87b2-4d0c-ad9f-76d936c0b518&tenantId=1146cf6d-9b72-4828-bd04-9f1ccb305586). This is a public team that anyone can join.

## Recommended development environment

Plugins can be installed directly from the IDE

* Visual Studio Code
* Ionide-fsharp plugin
* Fantomas formatter
  * This formatter is used by default from Ionide when you _right-click_ / _Format Document_ from within some F# code
  * If the formatter is not found you will be prompted to install it (I use the global option)

## These files represent topics we discussed implementated in `F#`

* exercises.fsx - Building `zip` and `zipWith`
* list.fsx - Writing our own version of a Linked List
